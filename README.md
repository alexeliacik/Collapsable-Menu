<strong> In this project, I created form validation and connected it with the Firebase's database.  I controlled my whole form's elements with the 'formData' object.  I checked each form's validity with RegEx and added timestamp to show when comment was made. Submit button enables when all form elements are valid.</strong>

<strong> I did send and get data with axios while connecting Firebase. I stored the login password in the database also. I showed a spinner for better UI experience and used the useEffect method efficiently for moderating all these things. </strong>

<strong> For better performance, I added 'Lazy Loading' logic to my project. Comments page doesn't render as long as you don't visit it.
